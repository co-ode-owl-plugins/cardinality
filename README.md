# Cardinality View

## Description
An experimental alternative to the class description view that shows restrictions in relation to their cardinality.

If several different restrictions are along the same property with the same filler, it "merges" them into a single line to aid readability. It also provides hints as to whether a given set of restrictions are closed.

## Features

Auto-generate closure for a given property

## Find the plugin

Find it under the *Window | Views | Class views* menu
