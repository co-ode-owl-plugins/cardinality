<h2>Cardinality View</h2>
<p>An experimental alternative to the conditions widget that shows restrictions in
 relation to their cardinality. If several different restrictions are along the
  same property with the same filler, it "merges" them into a single line to aid readability.
   It also provides hints as to whether a given set of restrictions are closed.
